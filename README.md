# Trustless Agent Intensive Co-Learning

**Decentralized AI Agents** are becoming one of the most transformative topics in the Ethereum ecosystem. The introduction of **ERC-8004** marks a pragmatic and visionary step forward in this domain.

We believe that meaningful innovation doesn't always come from boardrooms or conference stages — it often starts with a late-night hack or a sudden spark in your code editor.

Bring your creativity, code, and maybe a cup of iced coffee — and help shape the next chapter of Decentralized AI Agents.

## ⏰ Program Timeline

- **Casual Hackathon**: Oct 27 - Nov 2, 2025. Hands-on implementation and creative exploration
- **Demo Day**: Nov 2, 2025. Submit on GitHub, live show, fun prizes

- **De-commercialized**: No mandatory prize pools or sponsor KPIs — bounty hunters stay away, creativity comes first.
- **Relaxed participation**: No forced all-nighters or on-site attendance; health and enjoyment matter.
- **Everyone wins**: Mentors present a unique award to every project, giving all ideas their moment.
- **Curated themes**: Carefully curated prompts that spark imagination and encourage playful, cutting-edge development

## 🧩 Why ERC-8004? Why Now?

**ERC-8004** addresses key limitations of traditional AI agent systems while preserving their core strength: enabling trustless, verifiable, and economically autonomous AI agents.

Key benefits:

- ✅ **Decentralized Identity** (works with existing Ethereum infrastructure)
- ✅ **Highly extensible** (supports custom validation logic and reputation systems)
- ✅ **Improved security model** (avoids centralized control and single points of failure)

This isn't just a fix — it's a new design space for AI agents, dApps, security, identity, and permissions.

**Now** is the time to build, test, question, and innovate — hands-on, from the ground up.
